Qtip
----

Qtip is a tooltip javascript library which does one thing... make tooltips! This library can be
used without a javascript library, but you get the benefits of *css expressions* if you want to
use a javascript library (well actually only prototype and jquery for now). So even though it does something as simple as tooltips, it doesn't lock you into a javascript library, but some of the features cannot be used (well maybe they could, but I got lazy... so feel free to fork and make changes if you want to). This is based on the work of Craig Erskine over at http://qrayg.com/, actually most of the original code is his, I just made slight modifications so that it'd be easier to use if you don't feel like digging into the source.
